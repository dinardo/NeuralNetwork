# NeuralNetwork

Feedforward, fully connected, Neural Network with stocastic gradient descent:
- designed with object oriented paradigm
- implemented with composition
- written in python programming language

Multivariate Aanalysis (`MVA.py`) implementation with Neural Network <br>
Synopsis: `python MVA.py -nv 2 -np 4 -nn 2 20 20 1 -sc` <br>
> i.e. 2 input variable | 4 perceptrons | 2 - 20 - 20 - 1 neurons | scramble
